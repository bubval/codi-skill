# CoDi C4 Component Grammar

## Declaration

A minimal valid `c4-component` diagram:

```yaml
PaymentAPI[c4-component]:
  - API[container, scope]: "Payment API"
  - APIBoundary[container-boundary]:
      - Controller[component]:
          description: "Handles payment requests"
          technology: "Axum"
      - Service[component]:
          description: "Coordinates payment workflow"
          technology: "Rust"
  - Controller --> Service:
      label: "Delegates command"
      protocol: "in-process"
```

## Shared CoDi Grammar

All CoDi diagrams are YAML. A file contains exactly one top-level mapping key with a bracketed diagram type. The top-level value is a YAML list. Node types use bracket annotations. Edges use `-->`, `<--`, or `<-->`.

Every property belongs to one of three buckets: `layout:` (nested map), `style:` (nested map), or semantic keys (bare top-level). Property keys are snake_case; node/edge type names are dash-case. `layout:` and `style:` maps are written in YAML block form only — inline `{ }` maps are not supported.

## Type-Specific Notes

- Mark the scoped container and nest components in a `container-boundary`; boundary children are plain nested list items with `- label:` as a property item.
- Keep supporting systems and containers outside the scoped boundary unless they are the scoped container.

## Nesting: The Uniform Body Rule

There is no `children:` keyword. Every body — the diagram body and any container body — is a YAML list, and each item is one of:

1. A **property item**: a single-key mapping such as `- layout:` (block map), `- style:` (block map), or `- label: "x"`, applied to the owning node.
2. An **edge**: arrow syntax.
3. A **child node**: `Name[type]`.
4. A **member string** (class-like types only).

A leaf node with only properties uses a plain mapping body instead:

```yaml
- Leaf[type]:
    description: "properties only"
    style:
      fill: "#eef2ff"
```

A container with properties AND children uses the list body with property items:

```yaml
- Parent[type]:
    - layout:
        direction: TB
    - style:
        fill: "#f8fafc"
    - ChildA[type]
    - ChildB[type]
    - ChildA --> ChildB
```

## Labels and Properties

A scalar string after a node colon becomes a node description. A scalar string after an edge colon becomes an edge label. Mapping values become structured properties and should be preferred for detailed diagrams.
